## üìù Project Overview

This is a demo banking application built with Spring Boot that implements basic banking functionalities. The project serves as a practical example of using GitHub Copilot to accelerate development while maintaining code quality and following best practices.

### Key Features

- Customer management with JPA
- Database migrations with Flyway
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Containerized testing with TestContainers
- Structured prompt engineering

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (for TestContainers)
- IntelliJ IDEA

### Running the Application Locally in IntelliJ

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Navigate to `src/test/java/no/experis/bgo/mybank/LocalSpringApplication.java`
3. Click the green play button next to the `main` method, or right-click and select "Run 'LocalSpringApplication.main()'"

This will start the application with:
- TestContainers configuration (automatically starts a PostgreSQL container)
- Flyway migrations for database setup
- The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`


### Alternative: Running with Gradle

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```


The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`
